/**
 * Immutable snapshot of the robot's estimated pose on the field (6DOF).
 *
 * <p>A {@code PoseEstimate} is produced by a {@link PoseEstimator} and consumed by drive
 * controllers, tasks, and debugging tools. It captures:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The robot's pose in the field coordinate system (if available).</li>
 *   <li>Whether a valid pose is currently available.</li>
 *   <li>A simple quality score (0–1) for selection/fusion/debugging.</li>
 *   <li>How "old" the estimate is relative to now.</li>
 *   <li>The absolute timestamp at which the underlying measurement was taken.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Field coordinate system (FTC)</h2>
 *
 * <p>Phoenix field-centric poses follow the <b>FTC Field Coordinate System</b> for the current game.
 * Importantly, the <b>meaning of the X/Y axes is season-dependent</b> (square vs diamond vs inverted
 * square). Phoenix therefore avoids hardcoding “+X is …” or “+Y is …” in core pose types.</p>
 *
 * <p>Reference (FTC official docs):</p>
 * <pre>
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/game_specific_resources/field_coordinate_system/field-coordinate-system.html
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>What is consistent across seasons:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code zInches} is height above the field floor, where <b>+Z is up</b>.</li>
 *   <li>{@code yawRad/pitchRad/rollRad} are rotations about +Z/+Y/+X respectively in the chosen field frame,
 *       using the right-hand rule.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Time semantics</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #timestampSec} is the time (in seconds, from an arbitrary monotonic epoch)
 *       at which the underlying measurement was taken.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ageSec} is the age of the estimate (how long ago the measurement was taken)
 *       <em>at the time the {@code PoseEstimate} instance was created</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
