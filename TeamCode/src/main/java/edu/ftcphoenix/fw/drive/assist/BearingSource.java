/**
 * Source of target bearing information for aiming.
 *
 * <h2>Role</h2>
 * A {@code BearingSource} answers the question:
 * <em>"Is there a target right now, and if so, at what bearing (angle)
 * relative to the robot?"</em>
 *
 * <p>This is intentionally small and generic so it can be used with
 * different sensor backends:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link AprilTagSensor} (AprilTags from a camera).</li>
 *   <li>Other vision targets in the future.</li>
 *   <li>Synthetic sources that always aim at a fixed heading.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is designed to pair with {@link TagAimController},
 * which converts a {@link BearingSample} into a turn command (omega).
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * Typical aim loop:
 * <pre>{@code
 * BearingSource bearing = ...;  // e.g., built from AprilTagSensor
 *
 * // In your TeleOp or Auto loop:
 * BearingSource.BearingSample sample = bearing.sample(clock);
 * double omega = aimController.update(clock, sample);
 * }</pre>

     * loop time and delta time, so sources can compute ages if needed.
